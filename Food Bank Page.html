Through technical training such as kitchen craft and barista skills, members can gain qualifications and confidence in a public facing environment where they are supported on their journey out of homelessness. We give trainees practical skills, refreshed confidence and the industry knowledge to equip them for future opportunities. Meanwhile, our customers eat and drink with us knowing that every purchase they make will help end homelessness.</p>

          <p>No one in the UK should be pushed into poverty and hunger and need a food bank’s help. We want to see a future where we can start seeing food banks close because everyone has enough money coming in to cover the costs of essentials.But until then, we need your help. Financial and food donations, corporate partnerships, fundraising challenges and volunteering opportunities are some of the ways to take action against poverty and hunger.</p>
