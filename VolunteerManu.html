<h1>Helping The Elderly</h1>

<p>There are many ways you can help, from supporting activities and outings to participating in quizzes or simply chatting over a cup of tea. Please see below opportunities to help the elderly</p>

<ul>

        <p>For the past 70 years, we have been supporting older people across the entire borough of Lambeth. We are a local independent charity who welcome anyone over the age of 55 to our services. We will support you in the second half of your life to make it as full, enjoyable and active as possible.</p>
